# FT-PR-viscosity-model
Viscosity model based on one-parameter friction theory (FT) plus Peng-Robinson (PR) equation of state according to Qui√±ones-Cisneros et al. https://doi.org/10.1016/S0378-3812(00)00474-X.
The viscosity of potential constituents and surrogate mixtures for hydrocarbon fuels can be calculated from this software.
